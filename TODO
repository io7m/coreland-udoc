XHTML bottom navbar is incorrect in outermost section. The problem is
that the last 'part' for the document is selected when file_finish() is
called.

Renderer flag to set whether or not subsections are listed in (contents).

Line numbers appear to be wrong in error messages.

Table cells can't be styled with CSS in HTML. It may be necessary
to add a 't-cell' tag.

Tags need formal definitions. For example, how should descendents
of para-verbatim tags behave?

Use dfo.h. udr_xhtml doesn't appear to be using it, for example.

The whole render API has too many structures. I don't like it.

Push root nodes and nodes from (include) into a hash table,
removing on the way out of the tree. If the same node is
entered twice, the document has recursively included itself.

Fix ConTeXt text output (dfo.h).

ConTeXt 'verbatim' output still fucking isn't (some hyphenation
in places).

Underscores in chapter/section titles cause rendering problems
in ConTeXt. This appears to be a bug in ConTeXt.

Need to escape characters in titles for ConTeXt.

ConTeXt tables.
