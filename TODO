Table cells can't be styled with CSS in HTML. It may be necessary
to add a 't-cell' tag.

Tags need formal definitions. For example, how should descendents
of para-verbatim tags behave?

Improve error messages (link to missing ref, for example).

A subsection tag seems desirable. Behaves exactly like a 'section'
except that it never appears in tables of contents and never causes
a split.

Use dfo.h. udr_xhtml doesn't appear to be using it, for example.

The whole render API has too many structures. I don't like it.

Push root nodes and nodes from (include) into a hash table,
removing on the way out of the tree. If the same node is
entered twice, the document has recursively included itself.

Fix ConTeXt text output (dfo.h).

ConTeXt 'verbatim' output still fucking isn't (some hyphenation
in places).

Need to escape characters in titles for ConTeXt.

ConTeXt tables.
